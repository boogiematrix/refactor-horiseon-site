## Updating to accessibility standards and cleaning up code
I was tasked with updating the codebase to meet accessibility standards so that the site would be optimized for search engines and more legible for users of screen readers. I began by fixing any broken links and reformatting the code to make it more legible. Then, I replaced most of the `<div>` tags with more descriptive semantically appropriate html tags, added `alt=""` attributes to the decorative images, and reorganized the stylesheet while removing any redundant descriptors.

I've included a link to the project:

a preview of the site:

and some of the code used:
